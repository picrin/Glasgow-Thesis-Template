The author very reasonably argues that because genomic coordinates of possible noncoding RNAs (\textbf{ncRNAs}) can't be easily inferred using computational analysis of a reference genome (no analogue of an ``Open Reading Frame'' for ncRNAs), Next-Gen has an advantage over microarrays in the process of discovering ncRNAs.}
